        <h2>What is Frontend Development?</h2>
        <p>
          Frontend development is all about crafting the **user-facing** part of
          a website. It’s what users see and interact with directly. The
          frontend is often referred to as the "client-side" of an application
          and is built using three core technologies:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</b> Provides the basic
            structure of web pages. It's used to define elements like headings,
            paragraphs, images, and links.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</b> Responsible for the
            presentation of web pages. CSS defines how HTML elements look—fonts,
            colors, layouts, and responsive design are all controlled by CSS.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>JavaScript:</b> The programming language of the web. JavaScript
            adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages, allowing them
            to respond to user inputs and perform actions without reloading the
            entire page.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These core technologies, when combined, form the basis of every
          website you see online. Whether you're building a personal blog or a
          complex web application, mastering these three technologies is
          essential.

        <h2>Popular Frontend Tools & Frameworks</h2>
        <p>
          While HTML, CSS, and JavaScript form the foundation of frontend
          development, modern projects often rely on additional **tools and
          frameworks** to streamline development, improve performance, and
          create more powerful applications. Below are three of the most
          widely-used frontend frameworks today:
        </p>
        <div class="grid">
          <div class="tool">
            <h3>React</h3>
            <p>
              <b>React</b> is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook. It’s
              known for its component-based architecture, which makes building
              complex, interactive user interfaces more efficient. React focuses
              on building reusable components that manage their own state,
              making code easier to maintain and scale.
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>Example:</i> React is commonly used to build single-page
              applications (SPAs) that dynamically update without full page
              reloads.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="tool">
            <h3>Vue.js</h3>
            <p>
              <b>Vue.js</b> is a progressive JavaScript framework known for its
              simplicity and ease of integration. It’s often considered more
              approachable than React or Angular, making it a popular choice for
              beginners. Vue allows developers to incrementally adopt its
              features, making it flexible for both small projects and
              large-scale applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>Example:</i> Vue.js is often used for developing interactive
              user interfaces and lightweight SPAs.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="tool">
            <h3>Angular</h3>
            <p>
              <b>Angular</b> is a full-fledged JavaScript framework maintained
              by Google. Unlike React or Vue, Angular comes with a complete set
              of tools to build large, enterprise-level applications. It’s built
              using TypeScript and is known for its strong typing, dependency
              injection, and powerful CLI (command-line interface).
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>Example:</i> Angular is commonly used in building robust,
              scalable applications for industries such as finance, healthcare,
              and e-commerce.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Each of these frameworks brings something unique to the table, so the
          right choice depends on the specific requirements of your project and
          your development goals.

        <h2>Essential Frontend Skills to Master</h2>
        <p>
          To become a proficient frontend developer, you'll need to master a
          variety of skills beyond just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These
          include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Responsive Design:</b> Ensuring your website looks good and
            functions well on all devices, from smartphones to large desktops.
            Tools like media queries in CSS and frameworks like Bootstrap can
            help you achieve responsiveness.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Version Control/Git:</b> Version control is essential for
            tracking changes in your codebase. Git is the most popular version
            control system, and platforms like GitHub allow for seamless
            collaboration on projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Debugging and Testing:</b> Frontend developers must be able to
            debug code effectively. Browser developer tools and testing
            libraries like Jest or Cypress are crucial for ensuring code
            quality.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>CSS Preprocessors:</b> Preprocessors like SASS and LESS make
            writing CSS more efficient by introducing variables, nesting, and
            other advanced features.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Build Tools:</b> Tools like Webpack, Gulp, or Parcel automate
            repetitive tasks such as minification, bundling, and transpiling,
            making your development process more efficient.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These skills will make you a more effective developer and prepare you
          to work on real-world projects, where performance and maintainability
          are key.
